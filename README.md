# swift-mirror
Script to mirror files from one Rackspace Cloud Files account/container/region to a different one.

Handy for redundancy across datacenters and keep a local copy of the objects.

Todo / Nice-to-have's:
 - Argument support (currently only config file is supported)
 - Concurrency
 - Proper logging
 - Local disk mirroring optional (currently creates and leaves files on disk)
